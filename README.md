# This is the Vercel version of the app on the Main branch

100 percent server-side rendered, including data fetching and mutations (POST request), with TypeScript and TailwindCSS 4.x.

Now, you will need to create a free tier Vercel account, and you have to set up Vercel CLI to deploy this app easily from the command line.

This app is deployed here: [https://react-router-framework-mode-ssr-ver.vercel.app/](https://react-router-framework-mode-ssr-ver.vercel.app/)

A YouTube video to accompany this project is coming soon.
